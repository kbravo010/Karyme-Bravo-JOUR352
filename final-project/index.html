                        After the Palisades Fire destroyed her son’s high school, Shoshanha Essakhar found herself among
                        the thousands of Los Angeles County parents wondering what to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was thinking, ‘Oh my God, we’re going to be doing Zoom for the next God knows how long,’” said
                        Essakhar. “It was a lot of fear, a lot of uncertainty.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fire devastated
                        <a href="https://schoolupdates.lausd.org/">Palisades Charter High School</a>, where Essakhar’s
                        son was a ninth grader, as well as two elementary schools in the Los Angeles Unified School
                        District.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Eaton Fire, which broke out around the same time in early January, severely damaged or
                        destroyed six school facilities in
                        <a href="https://www.pusd.us/news-details/">Pasadena Unified School District</a>. Together, the
                        fires disrupted learning for
                        <a href="https://www.undauntedk12.org/">more than 725,000 kids</a> and displaced thousands of
                        students from their schools, their homes or both.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But roughly a week later, Beverly Hills Unified School District abruptly stopped accepting
                        students displaced by the fires, closing the door on Essakhar’s son and dozens of other students
                        who expected to spend the semester at Beverly Hills High.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a mom, you try to do your best for your child, but it got so unpleasant,” Essakhar said.</p>
                    <p>
                        Beverly Hills school leadership said it could not afford to accept additional students, nor did
                        it need to: Students who lost their school but whose homes were still intact did not need their
                        help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The dispute between Beverly Hills Unified School District and some Palisades parents raises
                        questions that school districts across the U.S. increasingly must grapple with as wildfires and
                        other extreme weather events become more common because of climate change: What does a school
                        district owe its neighbors after a major disaster?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Beverly Hills Unified, the answer was admitting 47 students before pausing enrollment over
                        concerns that a surge of newcomers midyear would siphon resources from the district’s 3,000-plus
                        existing students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “You’ve got a community where a lot of those folks lost their homes, and half lost their school
                        but their homes weren’t impacted,” said Los Angeles Unified School District board member Nick
                        Melvoin, whose district includes Palisades Charter High School. Like Beverly Hills, its students
                        are predominantly from affluent backgrounds.

                    <p>
                        Newsom’s order was an attempt at a fix: It urged districts to “extend every effort to support
                        and facilitate the enrollment of students displaced by the fires.” Lori Peek, director of the
                        Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado, Boulder, which focuses on the societal
                        effects of disasters, said it “provided the necessary flexibility that disaster survivors really
                        need, because their circumstances are so diverse.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Beverly Hills, school board members resisted the order. Beverly Hills is one of the few
                        “basic aid” districts in the state, meaning it collects more in local property tax revenue than
                        an annual funding target set by the state, which is based on average daily attendance and other
                        factors. Most districts fall short of the target, and the state makes up the difference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At a series of meetings in January and February, Beverly Hills school board members argued that
                        the district couldn’t absorb additional students without harming those already enrolled. While
                        other school districts see increased funding from increased attendance, that’s not true for
                        basic aid districts like Beverly Hills.
                    </p>
                    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider" data-src="visualisation/22897225"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22897225/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="photo-slider visualization" /></noscript>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Board members also questioned whether students who lost their schools, but not their homes, such
                        as Essakhar’s son, should be considered affected by the fire and able to enroll. Board members
                        told district administration that they believed only students whose homes were destroyed should
                        qualify.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not so, said Melissa Schoonmaker with the Los Angeles County Office of Education, which provided
                        guidance to the county’s school districts on implementing the order. “It’s not that they had to
                        lose their home or be evacuated, it could be a broad range of impacts,” she said.
                    </p>
                    <p>Board members supported making this pause permanent.</p>
                    <p>
                        “Going forward we are closed to any enrollment that comes right now as a result of a student
                        going to Pali who has not been displaced from their home but would like to come to Beverly Hills
                        because they don’t want to go on Zoom,” board President Rachelle Marcus said at the meeting,
                        referring to Palisades Charter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Essakhar, who lives in Brentwood, a Los Angeles neighborhood roughly halfway between Beverly
                        Hills and the Pacific Palisades, called the entire process traumatic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She gave up on finding an in-person school option for her son, settling instead for Zoom through
                        Palisades Charter. “Honestly, I didn’t want to go through the experience again,” she said. Plus,
                        most of his friends who left Palisades Charter had enrolled at Beverly High. “Being with your
                        group of friends is different than sending my kid alone to some other school to transition in
                        the middle of the year after the fires on his own,” said Essakhar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another Palisades Charter parent, Negeen Ben-Cohen, was initially optimistic that the school
                        would quickly secure a temporary campus. But as the weeks went by, she started considering other
                        options for her ninth grader.

                            "It was mostly about keeping my son in a healthy social environment, and not isolated at

                            behind during Zoom."

                    <p>
                        Like Essakhar, Ben-Cohen filled out all the necessary paperwork to enroll her son and was told
                        she would hear soon about his class placements. Then enrollment was paused.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “They shut the door in our faces. And that was after the kids got their hopes up, they think
                        that they’re going to be able to go in-person, they think they’re going to be able to start with
                        their friends,” said Ben-Cohen.
                    </p>
                    <p>At board meetings, parents and students expressed similar outrage.</p>

                        “We do not even want to get an education in a school that kicks others while they are down, you
                        have lost the opportunity to teach your students how to be there for each other,” said another
                        Palisades student, junior Rosha Sinai, calling the board “selfish.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jason Hasty, the interim superintendent of Beverly Hills Unified School District, said in an
                        interview that enrolling any more than 47 students would have strained the district’s resources
                        and required hiring more teachers — although he acknowledged that his district is better funded
                        than most.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We get more money than the state formula because of the way we’re funded. That is a fact. Also
                        what is a fact is on July 1 of every year, we set a budget … based on the students we are
                        projecting to have,” Hasty said.

                    <p>
                        State Sen. Ben Allen, who represents both the Pacific Palisades and Beverly Hills areas, said
                        that Beverly Hills would be compensated for taking in displaced students, although the details
                        are still being worked out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We’re going to have their backs and that they’re going to be fully compensated for any students
                        that they take in,” he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hasty said the district has been “in direct discussion” with Allen’s office, but “until we are
                        sure that those funds are materializing and will be provided,” the pause on enrollment under the
                        executive order (which expires at the end of the school year) remains in place. The district
                        continues to enroll students who move to Beverly Hills or who are eligible under the
                        <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/">McKinney-Vento Act</a>, said Hasty. That legislation provides
                        protections for students who are homeless, which is defined as “individuals who lack a fixed,
                        regular, and adequate, nighttime residence.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nearby Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District is also a basic aid district, but it
                        interpreted the order “to mean that any student who wants to come here can come here right now,”
                        said Gail Pinsker, the district’s chief communications officer. So far, the district has
                        enrolled more than 140 students, with about 200 enrollment requests still being processed. The
                        influx of students prompted the district to combine some elementary classes and hire a new high
                        school teacher, Pinsker said.

                        Three months after Palisades Charter High School burned, students remain on Zoom. The school
                        just finalized plans to use an
                        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/">old department store building</a> in downtown Santa
                        Monica about 20 minutes southeast of the high school as its temporary campus. In-person
                        instruction should resume sometime after the school’s
                        <a href="https://www.palihigh.org/">spring break</a> in mid-April, according to Palisades

                        country.”
